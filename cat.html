<br>Common Admission Test or CAT is the major and most popular MBA entrance exam for admission in 20 IIMs and over 100 B-schools across India. Conducted by IIMs on a rotational basis, CAT undergoes major changes or introduction of new elements every year. CAT 2018 is expected to be notified by IIMs in the last Sunday of July 2018. It is likely that CAT 2018 will be held in the last week of November. <br>	The CAT 2018 registration process is scheduled to commence from the first week of August 2018. Around two lakh candidates apply and appear for the computer-based test every year. Last year has been marked as one of the milestones for CAT owing to the release of official question paper and answer key.
	<br>IIM Calcutta and IIM Kozhikode are the biggest contenders to convene CAT 2018, although any of the other top four IIMs can be assigned this responsibility. During the last 5 years, only these two IIMs have not convened the Common Admission Test (CAT).
