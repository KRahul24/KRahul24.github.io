<h2 align=center style="color:#B4A97H"><b>Joint Entrance Examination(MAIN)</b><br></h2>	

<p class="paragp">Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main is conducted to offer admissions to interested candidates in undergraduate engineering programmes at NITs (National Institutes of Technology), IIITs (Indian Institutes of Information Technology) and other centrally funded technical institutions (CFTIs) located across the country.<br>Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is an engineering entrance examination conducted for admission to various engineering colleges in India. 
       It is constituted by two different examinations - JEE Main and the JEE Advanced. The exams are of the objective pattern. 
	   JEE Advanced is regarded internationally as one of the most challenging undergraduate admission tests.

In 2012, the government-run Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) that earlier conducted the AIEEE, announced the JEE that replaced the AIEEE 
and IIT-JEE. The JEE-Main, which replaces AIEEE, is for admission to the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information 
Technology (IIITs), and some other colleges designated as "centrally funded technical institutes" (CFTIs) The JEE-Advanced, which replaces IIT-JEE, 
is for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). <br>Only the students selected in JEE Mains are eligible for appearing in JEE Advanced. 

There are some institutes like the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, and 
the Indian Institute of Science which use the score obtained in JEE Advanced as the basis for admission. These are not participating institutes of 
central IIT JEE Advanced counseling of which all IITs are members.<br> Any student who takes admission to IITs cannot appear for the JEE-Advanced exam
in the next year, but the same is not the case with IISc, IISER, RGIPT and other institutes as these institutes only use JEE Advanced score for admission.

In September 2013, the IIT Council approved the decision of the Joint Admission Board to continue with the two-phase JEE pattern 
("Main" followed by "Advanced") for IITs in 2014. Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) conducted the joint admission process for a total of 23 IITs,
 ISM, 32 NITs, 18 IIITs and 19 other Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs).

As per the reports from Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of Government of India, the government is considering to conduct only one 
common engineering entrance test based on the lines of NEET for all engineering colleges, including private institutions, across India.
